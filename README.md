## Technical Details üîß

### Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask web framework with CORS support
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with modern styling
- **Text Processing**: PyPDF2 for PDF extraction, custom algorithms for analysis
- **Storage**: In-memory document storage (documents persist during server session)

### Key Components

#### DocumentProcessor
- Handles PDF and TXT text extraction
- Splits documents into manageable paragraphs
- Supports multiple text encodings

#### TextAnalyzer
- Generates document summaries
- Finds relevant context for questions
- Creates contextual answers with justification
- Extracts key concepts (names, dates, technical terms)
- Generates challenge questions based on document content
- Evaluates user answers with scoring system

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Serves the main HTML interface |
| `/upload` | POST | Handles document upload and processing |
| `/ask` | POST | Processes questions and returns answers |
| `/challenge` | POST | Generates challenge questions |
| `/evaluate` | POST | Evaluates user answers |
| `/health` | GET | Health check endpoint |

### File Structure

```
smart-research-assistant/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Main Flask application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Frontend interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/            # Document storage directory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
```

## Configuration Options ‚öôÔ∏è

### Environment Variables

- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Directory for uploaded files (default: `uploads`)
- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`: Maximum file size in bytes (default: 16MB)

### Customization

The application can be customized by modifying:

- **Text Analysis**: Adjust algorithms in `TextAnalyzer` class
- **UI Theme**: Modify CSS styles in `index.html`
- **Question Generation**: Customize logic in `generate_challenge_questions()`
- **Answer Evaluation**: Adjust scoring in `evaluate_answer()`

## Troubleshooting üîç

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Support Disabled**
   ```bash
   # Install PyPDF2 if not already installed
   pip install PyPDF2
   ```

2. **File Upload Fails**
   - Check file size (must be under 16MB)
   - Ensure file format is PDF or TXT
   - Verify `uploads/` directory exists

3. **Text Extraction Issues**
   - Some PDFs may have embedded text that's difficult to extract
   - Try converting PDF to text format first
   - Ensure text encoding is UTF-8 or Latin-1

4. **Server Won't Start**
   - Check if port 5000 is available
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check Python version (requires 3.7+)

### Debug Mode

The application runs in debug mode by default. To disable:

```python
app.run(debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

## Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Document Storage**: Documents are stored in memory and lost when server restarts
- **Concurrent Users**: Basic in-memory storage may not handle high concurrency well
- **PDF Complexity**: Complex PDFs with images/tables may not extract text properly
- **Language Support**: Optimized for English text processing
- **File Size**: Limited to 16MB per document

## Future Enhancements üöÄ

- Database integration for persistent storage
- Support for additional file formats (DOCX, RTF)
- Advanced NLP models for better question answering
- User authentication and document management
- Batch processing for multiple documents
- Export functionality for Q&A sessions
- Multi-language support
- Advanced search capabilities
