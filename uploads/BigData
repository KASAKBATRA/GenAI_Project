 Introduction
 The quantity of data created by humans is quickly increasing every year as a result of the
 introduction of new technology, gadgets, and communication channels such as social networking
 sites.Big data is a group of enormous datasets that can't be handled with typical computer methods.
 It is no longer a single technique or tool; rather, it has evolved into a comprehensive subject
 including a variety of tools, techniques, and frameworks.Quantities, letters, or symbols on which a
 computer performs operations and which can be stored and communicated as electrical signals and
 recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical media.
 1.1 What is Big Data
 Big Data is a massive collection of data that continues to increase dramatically over time. It is a data
 set that is so huge and complicated that no typical data management technologies can effectively
 store or process it. Big data is similar to regular data, except it is much larger.Big data analytics is
 the use of advanced analytic techniques to very large, heterogeneous data sets, which can contain
 structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, as well as data from many sources and sizes
 ranging from terabytes to zettabytes.
Big data is a term that defines the massive amount of organized and unstructured data that a
 company encounters on a daily basis.

 Examples of Big Data
 Figure 2 shows an example of big data. Every day, 500+ terabytes of fresh data are absorbed into
 the Facebook systems. This information is mostly gathered through photo and video uploads,
 message exchanges, and the posting of comments, among other things.

 In 30 minutes of flying time, a single Jet engine may create 10+ gigabytes of data. With thousands of
 flights every day, the amount of data generated can amount to several Petabytes.Every day, the
 Fresh York Stock Exchange creates around a terabyte of new trading data.
